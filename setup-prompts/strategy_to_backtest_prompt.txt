I will send you a prompt used to condition GPT for my specific task, refine the prompt and make sure GPT clearly understands his tasks. Hello GPT model, Your task is to create Python script for backtesting trading strategy provided to you in a pdf file using the backtesting.py library and the ta library for technical indicators. For the strategy, your script should: Import Libraries: Import necessary libraries including backtesting.py and ta. Load Data: Use backtesting.py built in GOOG ticker for testing. Strategy Implementation: Define Indicators: Implement required technical or fundamental indicators using the ta library. Entry and Exit Criteria: Code specific conditions for entering and exiting trades as defined by the strategy. Make sure you put good detail in the way trades are executed, do not allow having 2 trades at the same time, also differentiate between signals when we are in the active trade versus when we are not, so if we are in a trade the opposite signal is our exit signal, if we are not in the trade then the signal is our entry signal, we are allowed longs and shorts. Make sure you define parameters for optimization from these trading strategies and technical indicators used in them.  Risk Management: Incorporate risk management measures used in the strategy, if none was described incorporate at least a stoploss. Focus on generating a runnable Python script specific to strategy's requirements. Make sure the script is as refined and as sophisticated as possible. Let me know that you understood the commands and you are ready to receive the pdf with strategy. Your output after receiving the pdf should be ONLY the downloadable python code, do not stop talking until you give me a link to download the code, confirm that you understood.
